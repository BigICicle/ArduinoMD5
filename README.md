This is an MD5 library for the Arduino, based on scottmac's MD5 library, which you can find here:
https://github.com/scottmac/arduino

I created this because I was having a really hard time finding an easy-to-install and use libray for the Arduino,
so I decided to make my own. There is an example on how to use it.

### Installation
Simply copy the MD5 folder, and paste in in the _libraries_ folder inside your Arduino sketch folder. If the
libraries folder doesn't exist, create it.
